## Description
It consists in an android application developed in Java to help customers and workers from hostelry sector to make and handle orders removing workload, streamlining the process and making it more convinient for both sides.

## Functionality
The application has two parts. On one hand, you can log in as a customer and you will be able to add different products to your "cart" to finally send an order to the restaurant/bar if everything is correct. On the other hand, you can log in as a worker. From here, you will be able to see each table order in real time, assign the status of each order, and generally manage the restaurant side.

## Application State
This is just a demo, the application is far from finished. The result is what we've done with the time the center gave to us. There are plenty of bugs to fix and security issues, we wanted to add lot more functionalities such as the business side registration, customer feedback, more worker/company management options, and lots of little ideas to improve the experience of the customers and make the app more useful.
